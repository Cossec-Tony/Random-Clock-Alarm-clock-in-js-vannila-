# Random-Clock

The project consists of connecting your youtube playlist to an alarm clock which,
when it wakes you up, randomly chooses music from your playlist and plays it.
I strongly advise you to open the application with Opera on computer,
and Yandex on mobile because otherwise the music does not launch. (this is a small web-app project).
Do not hesitate to give me feedback, especially at the levels of youtube advertising that I have not been able to find a solution.
